# React Native Uncommon Error: Accessing State Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it's been initialized by the `useState` hook. The error manifests as undefined values or unexpected behavior.

## The Problem

When using `useState`, the initial state value is set asynchronously.  Directly accessing the state within the component's initial render may result in `undefined` since the state hasn't been assigned yet.  This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

Use optional chaining (`?.`) or nullish coalescing (`??`) to handle the potential `undefined` value gracefully.  Alternatively, conditionally render the component's content based on whether the state is ready.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
4. Observe the initial behavior (error) and the fixed behavior after applying the solution.
