This solution uses the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to provide a default value if the state is undefined.  Alternatively, you could use optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access properties of the state object if needed.

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  //Problem: Accessing count before it's initialized
  //console.log(count);

  //Solution: Nullish Coalescing Operator
  const displayCount = count ?? 0;

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Count: {displayCount}</Text>      
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
